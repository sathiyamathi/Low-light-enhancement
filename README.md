Low-light-enhancement using mirnet model and keras

With the goal of recovering high-quality image content from its degraded version, image restoration enjoys numerous applications, such as in photography, security, medical imaging, and remote sensing. In this example, we implement the MIRNet model and using keras for low-light image enhancement, a fully-convolutional architecture that learns an enriched set of features that combines contextual information from multiple scales, while simultaneously preserving the high-resolution spatial details.

#Low light imaging and low light image enhancement have wild applications in our daily life and different scientific research fields, like night surveillance, automated driving, fluorescence microscopy, high speed imaging and so on. However, there is still a long way to go in dealing with these tasks, considering the great challenges in low photon counts, low SNR, complicated noise models, etc. Here, we collect a list of resources related to low light image enhancement, including datasets, methods/codes/papers, metrics, and so on. We hope this can help to provide some help to the development of new methods and solutions to the low light tasks.

Download the train images and test images and run the code in the kaggle. You can also download the datasets from the kaggle.
For running the code you must have an kaggle account in order to run the code.
